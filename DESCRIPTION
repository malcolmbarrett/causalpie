Description: Causal pies are a way of visualizing the sufficient causes 
  framework. Sufficient causes are what must occur before some event happens. The 
  components of what causes the event may be in any or all sufficient causes, and 
  those that are in all are called necessary causes. The sufficient cause 
  framework was developed by Kenneth Rothman as a way of thinking about causes of 
  disease in epidemiology.
